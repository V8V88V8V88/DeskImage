# Screenshot Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the application screenshot. 

To add a screenshot:
1. Capture a screenshot of your DeskImage application running
2. Save it as `screenshot.png` in the root directory of the project
3. The screenshot will then be displayed in the README.md file

For best results, take the screenshot with the application in dark mode showing the main interface with:
- The installation section (if not installed)
- The file selection area
- Status messages (preferably a success message)
